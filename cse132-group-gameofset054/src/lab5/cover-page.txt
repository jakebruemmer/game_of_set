Coverpage for Lab 5 (Set Game) Jake Bruemmer 419767, Allison Zastrow 423550, Kathleen Szabo 420502

We decided to bring the Client into our GUI. This is what Jake had done for this WeasleyClock and it worked out 
reasonably well for him there. We ran into some issues using the data stream from the GUI at first, but we were
able to work through the problems we faced somewhat ok.

The NetworkView isn't used in our design because the "server" is controlled by the GameController class and each
PlayerHandler is associated with a particular Client. The PlayerHandler for each Client communicates with the 
GameController and the GUI gets updated through that communication. We used the SetMsgInput and SetMsgOutput classes
to trim down the code that we had in our while true loops on both the client and server side.

We ran out of time to test the end of the game thoroughly, but we're confident that the code that we have for the 
end of the game will do its job.
